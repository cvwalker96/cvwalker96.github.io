# A brief blurb about yourself
content: I'm a spatial data scientist and PhD candidate at LSU. My work centers on fundamental spatial questions — where are things located, how do they move, why do patterns emerge where they do, and can we predict what happens next? I use fish movement in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi River as a model system, but the methods I develop apply across ecology, public health, and urban systems. I work with telemetry, GIS, spatial statistics, and movement modeling. I enjoy turning complex data into actionable insights and communicating research through clear visualizations.
